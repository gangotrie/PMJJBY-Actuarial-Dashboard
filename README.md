**Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema (PMJJBY) – Actuarial Modelling & Financial Viability
Project Overview

This project evaluates the actuarial and financial viability of the PMJJBY insurance scheme using mortality rates from IALM (2006–08).
Key actuarial calculations such as reserves, expected death claims, and Death Strain at Risk (DSAR) are modeled and visualized in Power BI.

Tools & Techniques

Power BI → Dashboard visualizations

Excel → Data preparation & calculations

Actuarial concepts → Reserves, Mortality Rates, DSAR

Key Results

Calculated reserves of ₹3.2 lakh for the PMJJBY scheme

Simulated Death Strain at Risk (DSAR) for a policyholder aged 18 over 33 years

Identified trends in reserves, mortality rates, and expected death claims
